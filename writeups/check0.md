This lab took me about [n] hours to do. I [did/did not] attend the lab session.

My secret code from section 2.1 was: [code here]

I was surprised by or edified to learn that: 

1. how a tcp-socket connect to a server
2. molden cpp standard and new characteristics like virtual func
3. learn more about tcp protocol
4. improved programming  ability  

Implementation Challenges:

1. how to begin without a specific example, that i have to go deep into documentation and the existing public interfaces, especially at the beginning
2. a common way to solve programing problem: clarify goal and fix it step by step

Remaining Bugs:

performance:
  ByteStream throughput (pop length 4096): 10.69 Gbit/s
  ByteStream throughput (pop length 128):   2.37 Gbit/s
  ByteStream throughput (pop length 32):    0.66 Gbit/s
it does not perform well ,that i can do it better.
and i do not completely understand how peek func works
