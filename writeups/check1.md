Checkpoint 1 Writeup
====================

My name: [your name here]

My SUNet ID: [your sunetid here]

I collaborated with: [list sunetids here]

I would like to thank/reward these classmates for their help: [list sunetids here]

This lab took me about [n] hours to do. I [did/did not] attend the lab session.

I was surprised by or edified to learn that: [describe]

Report from the hands-on component of the lab checkpoint: [include
information from 2.1(4), and report on your experience in 2.2]

Describe Reassembler structure and design. [Describe data structures and
approach taken. Describe alternative designs considered or tested.
Describe benefits and weaknesses of your design compared with
alternatives -- perhaps in terms of simplicity/complexity, risk of
bugs, asymptotic performance, empirical performance, required
implementation time and difficulty, and other factors. Include any
measurements if applicable.]

Implementation Challenges:
1. figure out how an assembler works
2. handle multiple cases with the help of debugger

Remaining Bugs:
1. writer should close when is_last_substring and eof received which are not mentioned in docs
2. unify index as absolute index
3. write helper functions to solve problems that are easily to debug
4. debug step by step and carefully
5. if trapped in a bug for a long time, try asking help from Internet or AI

- Optional: I had unexpected difficulty with: [describe]

- Optional: I think you could make this lab better by: [describe]

- Optional: I'm not sure about: [describe]
